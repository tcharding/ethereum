Library for interacting with Ethereum
=====================================

This repository is partly for me to learn how to program Ethereum and partly to
be used in a closed source work project. It is largely made up of code stolen
from open source repositories. Collecting all the code here in case I happen to
make any improvements then they can be upstream from here.
